1. Sum Values
Write a function named sum_values that takes a dictionary named my_dictionary as a parameter.
The function should return the sum of the values of the dictionary

1. Count Letters
Write a function called unique_english_letters that takes the string word as a parameter. The function should return the total number of unique letters in the string. Uppercase and lowercase letters should be counted as different letters.
Weâ€™ve given you a list of every uppercase and lower case letter in the English alphabet. It will be helpful to include that list in your function.

2. Count X

3. Write a function named count_multi_char_x that takes a string named word and a string named x. This function should do the same thing as the count_char_x function you just wrote - it should return the number of times x appears in word. However, this time, make sure your function works when x is multiple characters long.
For example, count_multi_char_x("Mississippi", "iss") should return 2
# Write your count_multi_char_x function here:
def count_multi_char_x(word, x):
 count = 0; c = 0
 for w in range(len(word)):
   c += 1

4. Check Name
Write a function called check_for_name that takes two strings as parameters named sentence and name. The function should return True if name appears in sentence in all lowercase letters, all uppercase letters, or with any mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. The function should return False otherwise.
For example, the following three calls should all return True:
# Write your check_for_name function here:
